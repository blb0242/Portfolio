              Born and raised in the lovely city of Dallas, TX. Before I became a web developer I was a basketball player, specifically a point guard. I always had a dream of making the NBA but soon realized my 5'11" height was going to make it very hard to make the NBA. So, I decided maybe I should care bout learning things more so I can have something to depend on if the basketball thing doesnt work. 6 1/2 years of college and a year out of school, here I am. Took me a while to realize that only having a degree wasnt going to get me in a career easily, so I began to build my portfolio. Now, my spare time is dedicated to finding a job, build my portfolio by doing freelance jobs, taking care of my daughter and delivering pizza at i Fratelli Pizza. With more work and a little bit of luck I know my NBA dream that is now a Software Developer dream, will come true soon.
